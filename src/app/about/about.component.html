          We are bringing numbers into the farming game. By installing our
          system, Farmers can login to their system and see data visualization
          of the environmental factors surrounding their crops. This allows for
          farmers to see how their crops are doing over different spans of time.
          By doing this, farmers can have a better understanding of the
          environment surrounding their crops, thus making adjustments and
          getting better yields.

          This system was built using many frameworks and packages. We utilized
          things like Angular, NodeJS, and ChartJS as well PHP, mySQL, and
          EngineX. By combining all of these, we were able to create an embedded
          system that could collect data, store it in a database. That database
          is then accessed for authentication, and to get the data for the data
          visualization. This all is then sent to the client, where it is
          displayed nicely for the customers to view.
